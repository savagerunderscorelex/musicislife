            <p id="site_intro">I created this website as a <em>tribute</em> to my favorite music artists and bands. I've always wanted to share my
            music taste with more people, especially since the music artists I listen to would be considered "obscure." Through this website,
            I hope to share underrated artists and bands people might like but would have never heard about otherwise.</p>
