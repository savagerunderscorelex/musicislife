I wanted to start using bootstrap in my project to expand my frontend development knowledge. So in this project, I'm learning how to use bootstrap.js and maybe other frameworks (if I manage to learn them as well).
So far, I've added most of the artists/bands that I wanted to showcase in my project. However, the singles page is still in progress and I don't have a definite number of songs that I would add to that page. I added some artist pages while listening through my playlist.

Currently, I'm trying to add a collapsible side nav bar to the home page.
I'm having issues with the toggle event, and it's not working so far. I've been trying to adjust my code by fixing the variables and checking if I left any
element open, but I couldn't find any issues. I think this is the only thing I don't like about HTML: there aren't really things that tell you any "errors." :(

I've finally managed to fix the collapsible navigation bar code after 1.5+ hours.
I finished adding the navigation links for artists a-e.

7:46 PM I finished adding all of the artist navigation links! I'm working on creating a transitioning sidebar caret for the navigation directory for the artists. I also added glow for the names when they're hovered on. I think that I'll make the names buttons to make it more obviously that they're supposed to be clicked on.

11:15 PM I figured out the caret animation on my own! I looked for a solution for animating the caret for the sidebar on Stack Overflow and I found one. However, when I used the code,
it didn't work at all. I managed to fix it by removing some of the unnecessary code (the document addition to the function). I think this is an issue that comes up whenever I try to find solutions to some of my problems online: the solutions are usually old and don't match up with current versions of coding languages.

11:25 PM Figured out how to put the caret background below the caret! Used postion absolute and position: relative and had to switch around the order in html

9:43 AM I adjusted the sidebar so that it would be collapsed by default. I feel like most websites don't have the sidebar open usually, and I think leaving the sidebar uncollapsed would clutter the page when a user first opens it. i had to change its default direction and I feel so smart for figuring out myself hehe

One thing I want to do its make the main part of the page darken when the sidebar is open, mainly because a lot of websites do that. I want to figure out how to do it by myself first before I search up a solution.

4:46 PM Changed the font sizes of the sidebar links to make them smaller and to not make the page as long, I added the footer, and I also added back the paragraph with the description of what the site is.

9:43 PM Tried to add a div with the class container since a W3 Schools article I read said that every element should be nested within one.

## 9/24

5:09 AM I started working on the ako page to figure out how to set up the artist page template. I created the photocard and centered an example photo and paragraph. I struggled a bit with centering the items in photocard (not me forgetting the css I learned from my last project).

6:19 AM I figured out how to put the artist information on the main easier (using grid display). The elements I'm adding now are just for figuring out how to code the layouts for my website, so they're currently weird colors and weird shapes because of that. So far, I made a photocard and created the vinyl circles. I'll try to finish it when I come back from school.

5:02 PM I finished the basic layout!! The CSS isn't pretty right now but I added the record player spot, the remaining 2 vinyls, the video, and adjusted the sizes of all the previous elements.
The only issue I have right now is that the design when the screen is smaller is off, unfortunately. I'll try to fix it later.

7:41 PM I haven't worked on this project for a while! I'm trying to redo the styling for the artist pages since it acted weird when the viewport was smaller.

7:50 PM I figured out the issue with the placeholder vinyls not going under (the float:right for the video container made the circles go left)

8:24 PM I'm working on getting the record player + vinyl part set up correctly. I'm using boostrap columns to make it a bit easier, and it has been a bit easier. I've been able to make the elements appear as a "block" instead of overlapping each other. I've also got the vinyl images as well.

I'm quitting now because i'm falling asleep and I've been coding for the last 6 hours.

I just need to the vinyls and the record player stay on the same line.

## 10/10

8:44 AM I got the record player and the vinyls mostly set. It's not mobile responsive unfortunately. I added a heading for the now playing song when a user clicks on one of the record players. I'm going to try to add the artist card to figure out the ratios and where everything is going to appear on the page.

## 10/20

9:15 PM I deleted most of the artist pages because I realized that doing the project at the scope I'm planning to do it rn is NOT going to work. I'm also no longer going to do the record playing feature for the same reason.

I'm just going to do 6 artists: lucy bedroque, bunii, twikipedia, ayowitty, julie, and laila. Random assortment but I think I'll have more fun creating a site based off these artists a bit more.

## 10/21

3:45 PM Removed Record Player

4:09 PM Removed all of the extra artists from the sidebar element of the ako page

## 10/22

5:29 AM Finally got the styling of the artist stuff to work!!! Now the photocard and the artist video are side by side.

5:54 PM LETSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I finally got the video container to stay on the right side, and i also got the video container child elements to be centered too!!!
