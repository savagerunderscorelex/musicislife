## Features to Implement + To Do

* ~~Figure out how to make a navigation dropdown~~
* Vinyl player with a couple songs (per artist) that visitors can click on to listen to
* Photo card of each artist/band with an overview about them
* A youtube video relating to the artist (either could be an interview, about who they are, a music video, or a recent song/album)
* List of social media and music streaming links for each artist
    * Instagram
    * Genius
    * Spotify
    * YouTube (just these four)
* Choose universal fonts for the website
* Sketch out layout for a basic artist page
* Maybe I should have music playing in the homepage? (i would probably have to warn users about it first, since some people don't recommend having background music)
* Figure out how to use typed.js
* design page layout (i'm gonna do this on paper since I don't have any drawing software rn (I really want that ipad!!!))
* Customize the scroll bar (maybe it changes in each page?)
