I wanted to start using bootstrap in my project to expand my frontend development knowledge. So in this project, I'm learning how to use bootstrap.js and maybe other frameworks (if I manage to learn them as well).
So far, I've added most of the artists/bands that I wanted to showcase in my project. However, the singles page is still in progress and I don't have a definite number of songs that I would add to that page. 
I added some artist pages while listening through my playlist. 

Currently, I'm trying to add a collapsible side nav bar to the home page.
I'm having issues with the toggle event, and it's not working so far. I've been trying to adjust my code by fixing the variables and checking if I left any 
element open, but I couldn't find any issues. I think this is the only thing I don't like about HTML: there aren't really things that tell you any "errors." :(

I've finally managed to fix the collapsible navigation bar code after 1.5+ hours. 
I finished adding the navigation links for artists a-e. 

7:46 PM I finished adding all of the artist navigation links! I'm working on creating a transitioning sidebar caret for the navigation directory for the artists. I also added glow for the names when they're hovered on. 
I think that I'll make the names buttons to make it more obviously that they're supposed to be clicked on.

11:15 PM I figured out the caret animation on my own! I looked for a solution for animating the caret for the sidebar on Stack Overflow and I found one. However, when I used the code,
it didn't work at all. I managed to fix it by removing some of the unnecessary code (the document addition to the function). I think this is an issue that comes up whenever I try to find solutions to some of my problems online: 
the solutions are usually old and don't match up with current versions of coding languages. 

11:25 PM Figured out how to put the caret background below the caret! Used postion absolute and position: relative and had to switch around the order in html

9:43 AM I adjusted the sidebar so that it would be collapsed by default. I feel like most websites don't have the sidebar open usually, and I think leaving the sidebar
uncollapsed would clutter the page when a user first opens it. i had to change its default direction and I feel so smart for figuring out myself hehe

One thing I want to do its make the main part of the page darken when the sidebar is open, mainly because a lot of websites do that. I want to figure out how to do it by myself first
before I search up a solution. 

4:46 PM Changed the font sizes of the sidebar links to make them smaller and to not make the page as long, I added the footer, and I also added back the paragraph with the description
of what the site is.
