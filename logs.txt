I wanted to start using bootstrap in my project to expand my frontend development knowledge. So in this project, I'm learning how to use bootstrap.js and maybe other frameworks (if I manage to learn them as well).
So far, I've added most of the artists/bands that I wanted to showcase in my project. However, the singles page is still in progress and I don't have a definite number of songs that I would add to that page. 
I added some artist pages while listening through my playlist. 

Currently, I'm trying to add a collapsible side nav bar to the home page.
I'm having issues with the toggle event, and it's not working so far. I've been trying to adjust my code by fixing the variables and checking if I left any 
element open, but I couldn't find any issues. I think this is the only thing I don't like about HTML: there aren't really things that tell you any "errors." :(

I've finally managed to fix the collapsible navigation bar code after 1.5+ hours. 
I finished adding the navigation links for artists a-e.
